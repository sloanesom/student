## The beginning

When I first started CompSci, I had to install the tools like VSCode, Homebrew, and make a Github account to be able to code. I learned that Github stores code information like Google Drive, and that VSCode allows for easy access and editing. Homebrew is a "package manager" that makes it much easier to code because MacOs doesn't come with a lot of information/commands. For example, "wget" is hard to use without homebrew, but the code "brew install wget" in terminal makes it very straightforward.

### Problem Busting

I experienced lots of confusion about files and folders. I learned that the pages and teampages repos both live in the opencs directory, while student lives in the "sloanesom" directory, which is my github username.


* **My Achievements**: A view into some of the things I've worked on in the past 4-5 weeks!
  * -I made an about.md page and learned how to insert images.
  * -I made a background.md and got a local server to run a moving image and background.
  * -I fixed a lot of problems regarding directories and locations of files.
  * -I learned how to use AI constructively to help me understand and then solve issues with my code.
  * -I learned how to set up a virtual environment through my terminal.
  * -And so much more! I can't wait to keep learning.



## Open Coding Society Accounts

As part of this course, you will need to create several accounts to participate in coding activities, collaborate with peers, and showcase your work. These accounts will require you to share some level of Personal Identifiable Information (PII). By applying the strategies discussed earlier, you can create and manage these accounts in a way that protects your privacy while enabling you to build a professional digital presence.

### Email Accounts

You will be using and sharing email accounts with the teacher and fellow students.

A strategy I employ is maintaining different email accounts according to the expected type or volume of information (junk email, common email, work/school email, important email). This is not about security, but it helps set an expectation for the "purpose," "value," or "importance" of information aggregated to that endpoint.

### GitHub Account

We want you to create a GitHub account. You will need to establish a GitHub user ID, username, and email. This can include one or more email accounts. We will ask that you make a name and email public. This account will be your social media account as a coder.

We suggest that you use a "common" email account for this platform. Don’t use your school email; GitHub will be with you long after you graduate from high school.

The email you make public should be in the same category as what you would share on more professional social media accounts, i.e., in the "common" email category.

**Examples of Professional User IDs**:

* **Good**:
  * `john-doe`: Simple, professional, and easy to remember.
  * `johndev`: Highlights your identity as a developer.
  * `jdoe123`: A clean and professional option if your preferred username is already taken.

* **Bad**:
  * `coolguy123`: Unprofessional and does not reflect your identity as a coder.
  * `john.doe2005`: Includes unnecessary personal information (e.g., birth year), which could compromise your privacy. The dot could be a problem on some platforms, stick to dash.  
  * `ilovecodinglol`: Informal and not suitable for professional platforms.

### GitHub Pages

We will ask you to publish a Student Portfolio using GitHub Pages. This will be a public website and will be indexed by Google and Google Analytics.

### Slack Account

We will ask you to create an account on Slack, which will require PII. We suggest that you use a "common" email account for this platform. We recommend that you don't use your school email.

PII in this category should be restricted to the teacher and fellow students. This includes students from the past, as we have allowed this to be open to those who were formerly enrolled. There are different Slack workspaces for CSSE, CSP, and CSA.

### Portfolio Account

We will ask you to create a user account based on your GitHub user ID. This will be used to build course lists, provide compute services (e.g., AWS, KASM), and aggregate analytics to your instructor.

PII in this category should be restricted to the teacher and fellow students. This includes students from the past, as we have allowed this to be open to those who were formerly enrolled.

## PII Strategy on Account Creation

As you navigate this course and the digital world, it is essential to establish and continually refine your Personal Identifiable Information (PII) strategy. You are likely already sharing some PII, but it’s important to evaluate what information is appropriate to share and how to protect it. By proactively managing your PII, you can safeguard your privacy while building a professional digital presence.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Categorize Information**:
   * **Public Information**: Information you are comfortable sharing publicly, such as your name and general interests.
   * **Sensitive Information**: Information that should be shared cautiously, such as your full birth date and phone number.
   * **Highly Confidential Information**: Information that should be kept strictly private, such as your social security number and internet access credentials.

2. **Use Different Email Accounts**:
   * Maintain different email accounts for different purposes (e.g., junk email, common email, work/school email, important email). This helps manage the type and volume of information you receive and sets expectations for the importance of the information.

3. **Be Prepared for Security Incidents**:
   * Anticipate potential security breaches and take proactive steps to secure your accounts. Regularly update your passwords, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), and monitor your accounts for unusual activity.

4. **Adapt and Evolve**:
   * As your digital footprint grows, continually reassess and adapt your PII strategy. Stay informed about the latest security practices and tools to ensure your strategy remains effective.

## Hacks

Create your course accounts.

As you create and manage your accounts, always be mindful of the information you are sharing. Protecting your PII is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and adaptability. By categorizing your information, using different email accounts, and preparing for potential security incidents, you can better safeguard your personal information.

### Checklist for Account Creation

Use this checklist to track your progress as you create the required accounts:

* **Email Account**: Create or use a personal email account (e.g., Gmail) for development and accessibility.  
  * **Sign Up**: [Create a Gmail Account](https://accounts.google.com/signup)  
  * Many tools support logging in with Gmail, making it a convenient choice. Avoid using your school email for these accounts. Since your Gmail prefix is unique in the world, it may be a good choice for User ID on other setups on this page.

* **Slack Account**: Register for Slack using your personal email (e.g., Gmail).  
  * **Sign Up**: [Create a Slack Account](https://slack.com/get-started#/)

* **GitHub Account**: Create a GitHub account using the same personal email.  
  * **Sign Up**: [Create a GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup)  
  * This account will serve as your professional social media account as a coder. Avoid using your school email, as GitHub will be useful beyond your time in school.

* **GitHub Pages**: Publish a Student Portfolio using GitHub Pages.  
  * **Learn More**: [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://pages.github.com/)  
  * This will be a public website indexed by Google and Google Analytics.

* **Open Society Account**: Create an account on the course's Open Society platform  
  * **Sign Up**: [Open Coding Society](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/)
  * Using your GitHub ID an account will be created to build course lists, provide compute services (e.g., AWS, KASM), and aggregate analytics for your instructor.
