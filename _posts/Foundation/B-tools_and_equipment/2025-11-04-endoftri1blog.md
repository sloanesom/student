## Compare yourself to the beginning of the year
At the beginning of the year, I started off honestly knowing nothing about coding and computers at all. My understandings of these things have grown largely throughout the first trimester, and 

## Remember key things from 3 sprints, Tools, Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python,  West Coast Travel or Digital Famine.
Tools- The most important thing I learned in this unit was that this class requires failure, and has a learning curve. I struggled a lot to learn where my files and folders were, and how to use Github. However, once I had these down, it became much easier to work in this class.

Fundamentals- I worked with Krishna on this assignment and I learned much more about implementing code cells on VScode, but more importantly I learned how to reinterpret the collegeboard content and make something new, that would help kids our age understand it better. Also, this entire project really helped me grow my collaboration skills because of the constant communications it required, with commits requiring a lot of attention.

Digital Famine- Digital Famine was a struggle for my team, and to be completely honest I would consider it more of a failure that I can learn from. From the start there were some red flags where Lucas was doing a lot of constructive work but not giving communication about it, and the whole idea became very muddied by the time we were actually coding. A lot of interactive and detailing stuff got lost in translation and our project was just very simple things, aside from some complex (and debatably off topic) aspects that Lucas created. I feel like I personally should've strived for greatness more, and created something that pushed my limits instead of a simple MCQ.

## How N@tM went?  Did you get a comment or two you liked?

Night at the Museum ran relatively smoothly, besides a couple bumps in the setup there was a lot of positive attention from the audience. Many people were asking questions and engaging which allowed us to elaborate on the topic and our demonstrate competency on the subject. If I could do one thing differently, I would have asked for more feedback throughout the project so we could make something more elaborate that demonstrated a higher skill set, to meet Mr. Mortenson's standards.
