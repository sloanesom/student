## Compare yourself to the beginning of the year
At the beginning of the year, I started off honestly knowing nothing about coding and computers at all. My understandings of these things have grown largely throughout the first trimester, and 

## Remember key things from 3 sprints, Tools, Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python,  West Coast Travel or Digital Famine.
Tools- The most important thing I learned in this unit was that this class requires failure, and has a learning curve. I struggled a lot to learn where my files and folders were, and how to use Github. However, once I had these down, it became much easier to work in this class.

Fundamentals- I worked with Krishna on this assignment and I learned much more about implementing code cells on VScode, but more importantly I learned how to reinterpret the collegeboard content and make something new, that would help kids our age understand it better. Also, this entire project really helped me grow my collaboration skills because of the constant communications it required, with commits requiring a lot of attention.

Digital Famine- Digital Famine was a struggle for my team, and to be completely honest I would consider it more of a failure that I can learn from. From the start there were some red flags where Lucas was doing a lot of constructive work but not giving communication about it, and the whole idea became very muddied by the time we were actually coding. A lot of interactive and detailing stuff got lost in translation and our project was just very simple things, aside from some complex (and debatably off topic) aspects that Lucas created. I feel like I personally should've strived for greatness more, and created something that pushed my limits instead of a simple MCQ.

## How N@tM went?  Did you get a comment or two you liked?

Night at the Museum ran relatively smoothly, besides a couple bumps in the setup there was a lot of positive attention from the audience. Many people were asking questions and engaging which allowed us to elaborate on the topic and our demonstrate competency on the subject. If I could do one thing differently, I would have asked for more feedback throughout the project so we could make something more elaborate that demonstrated a higher skill set, to meet Mr. Mortenson's standards.

## What do you want to do next on project, given time?
Collaboration wise, I want to establish an environment where everyone is on the same level in terms of work, not just in distribution of tasks. I want to be able to fully explain/understand the nuances of each part, and each other member should feel the same about mine. Also, more planning DURING the construction of the code will help us avoid another N@TM disaster.

If you are curious about a literal project, I'd really like to explore games or some type of story related lesson, maybe like a visual novel that makes learning fun and also catered to what kids these days like to do. In a visual novel there could be characters, a plotline and dialogue etc that tell a story about how to develop procedures or something similar, possibly with a broader topic.

## What do you want to learn next in CompSci?
I want to learn more about game development, especially how physics engines and animation work behind the scenes. I like seeing how code creates something interactive and visual, that connects with the player on an emotional level.

## MCQ review, score, correction, and approach
On the MCQ, I used the research strategy on questions where I had a basis of knowledge, but I wasn't sure. For questions I was completely unsure of, I simply left them blank and strategized to correct later. I got a score of 48/66.

Corrections: 

Q1: I didn't know how to approach this problem, so I skipped it and then researched. I discovered that to swap the values, you have to save the original first value in temp so you don’t lose it. Then you change first to the value in second. Finally, you set second equal to temp, which gives it the original first value.

Q9: I selected an incorrect option regarding the benefits of the iterative and incremental process of program development. Whereas I believed it allowed programmers to solve unsolvable problems, the purpose this proces actually serves is to identify errors as components that are added to a working program.

Q14:  I chose the wrong option on this question regarding the values that two programs display. I put that they displayed a different number of values, but I was confused. Program a shows the value before adding one, displaying 1-10; where program b adds 1 first and then shows the value, displaying 2-11. They both show 10 numbers, the values are just different.

Q15: I selected the wrong answer referring to Internet communication, saying that "devices from different manufactureres are required to run the same operating system to communicate over the internet". This isn't true, and devices such  Android and Apple can communicate just fine with different servers. They simply need to use the same internet protocols (like https), which are universal. So the correct option was that each device connect to the internet is assigned an Internet protocol (IP) address.

Q20: I put that Max (a, b) +Max (b, c) - Max (a, c) would find the greatest of 3 integer values a b and c, but the answer is actually Max (Max (a, b), c). I mostly just guessed on this one because I didn't understand it, but when I did research I found out  Max (a, b) gives you the larger of a and b, then Max of that result gives you the larger overall. The other options don't always return the biggest number.
