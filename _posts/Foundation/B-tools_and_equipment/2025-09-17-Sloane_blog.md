## Whack a mole

In my whack-a-mole game I was messing around with in VS Code, I changed a bunch of little things to make it look different. I swapped out the colors of the holes and even the outline so it didn’t look so plain. I also messed with the pink power-up, changing how long it lasts, and adjusted the multiplier so the score jumps were way bigger. It was cool seeing how just changing a few numbers or colors in the code could make the whole game feel new.

### Problem Busting

I ran into some simple problems while doing this. Like, if I typed the wrong color code or used the wrong selector in, the holes wouldn’t change at all. Or sometimes I’d forget to save and think nothing was working when it actually was. Even in the JavaScript, one tiny typo or extra bracket can mess up the power-up timer. Stuff like that can be frustrating, but it’s all part of messing around with code, and in the end I got it working.

For my rock paper scissors game, I went in and changed up the colors to make it look less basic. I switched the border colors and the background so the whole thing felt more lively. It was fun seeing how a few quick edits in the CSS could totally change the vibe of the game. It didn’t change how the game worked, but it definitely made it feel more personal.



## Problem Busting

While I was doing that, I ran into some issues with the images not showing up. Sometimes the paths were wrong, so the game would just show little question mark boxes instead of the actual pictures. Another thing that could happen is mixing up the file names or putting the images in the wrong folder. Even something small like forgetting to refresh the page or not saving the changes made it seem like nothing worked. Little mistakes like that can be annoying, but fixing them is part of figuring out how the code fits together.
