    "> These are some of the key files and directories in this project. Understanding these files will speed up your development \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `README.md`: This file contains instructions for setting up the necessary tools and cloning the project. A README file is a standard component of all properly set up GitHub projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `main.py`: This Python source file is used to run the project. Running this file starts a Flask web server locally on localhost. During development, this is the file you use to run, test, and debug the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__.py`: This file defines the Flask app, loads environment variables (from `.env`), and sets up security (like CORS) and database connections (SQLite or RDS). It acts as the main configuration and initialization hub for your backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`: These files are used to run and test the project in a Docker container. They allow you to simulate the project's deployment on a server, such as an AWS EC2 instance. Running these files helps ensure that your tools and dependencies work correctly on a clean machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `instances`: This directory is the standard location for storing data files that you want to remain on the server. For example, SQLite database files can be stored in this directory.  Files stored in this location will persist after a web application restart. Everything outside of instances will be recreated at restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `api`: This directory contains code that receives and responds to requests from external servers. It serves as the interface between the external world and the logic and code in the rest of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `model`: This directory holds class definitions for interacting with the database (like SQLAlchemy models). Models can also connect to third-party APIs or machine learning libraries. By keeping data logic in `model`, you make your code reusable and keep the `api` code simple and clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the dependencies required to turn this Python project into a Flask/Python project. It may also include other backend dependencies, such as dependencies for working with a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.gitignore`: This file specifies elements to be excluded from version control. Files are excluded when they are derived and not considered part of the project's original source. In VSCode Explorer, you may notice some files appearing dimmed, indicating that they are intentionally excluded from version control based on the rules defined in .gitignore."
